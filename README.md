# Simple Drawing App

This is a simple drawing app to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer and get some practice with Typescript.

For this software, I experimented with a few different technologies - mainly classes, displaying output in the form of drawings in the browser, and recursion to generate shapes. When the code is run, you can draw inside a simple canvas and click a button to generate a square shape. You can also click a button to clear the canvas.

My main objective in writing this software was, as stated above, to get some experience in Typescript and experiment with new technologies. Before this point, I had never really tried to develop a drawing system using code. It was quite enlightening and I am excited to experiment with this further.
